# Online-Pharmacy-Hub
In Sri Lanka, there are different platforms: web applications or mobile applications for pharmacy services. There isn't a centralized platform where people can view or buy products from multiple pharmacies without travelling and finding pharmacies nearest to their current location.

As a solution for this problem, Team Noobz69 introduced Online Pharmacy Hub.

Online Pharmacy Hub is a mobile application which facilitates people's ability to search for or buy pharmacy products and services conveniently from anywhere and anytime through an online centralized platform with multiple pharmacies.

Primarily, users can,

1. Upload prescriptions.

- Users can upload their prescription as a JPG, PNG or any other supported image formats to the app.
- Then the pharmacies (registered with Online Pharmacy Hub) near to user's location can see the prescription.
- One of them will accept it and start to process the medicines.
- Pharmacies can send notification to patients for each stage of the process (Processing order, Finished processing order, Ready to pickup).
- Patients can chat with pharmacies and ask questions and gather information through Chat option.
- After finishing the order, patients can do the payment and choose the delivery option (Delivery or Pickup).

2. Search medicines and pharmacies, place orders and create accounts in Online Pharmacy Hub.

There is a seperate web application for pharmacies for managing their orders and other activities. They can,

- Register their pharmacy in Online Pharmacy Hub.
- Accept prescriptions from nearest patients.
- Manage orders.
- Upload medicines and other items to their Pharmacy Profile.

Tools and Technologies: Java, XML, HTML, CSS, Js, Spring Boot, Digital Ocean, Firebase, GitHub, VS Code, Draw.io, Photoshop, Figma and Adobe XD.

Online Pharmacy Hub is made by Team Noobz69, a team consist of ten IT undergraduates of SLTC Research University as the project for Cloud App Development module in 6th semester.
